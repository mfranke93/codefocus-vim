This is my own extension of the codefocus colorscheme available at
(alexanderlobov/config)[https://github.com/alexanderlobov/config/blob/master/vim/colors/codefocus.vim].
The original colorscheme did not include GUI configurations for the colors.
Additionally, because the configuration was only a file in a larger repository,
I did not want to fork it, and instead decided on leaving a reference to the
original source here.
